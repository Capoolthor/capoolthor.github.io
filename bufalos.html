                 <dd><font color=800080>At the beginning, I was filled with uncertainties, unsure if I would feel
                    comfortable until at some point, it became a part of my reality, and I felt more confident after
                    a long time. Initially, I didn't plan on forming emotional connections with any classmates or teachers,
                    but it wasn't entirely possible. Only in the first two years until the fateful 3rd grade (9th grade) arrived,
                    and true emotions blossomed towards those close to me. I grew closer to teachers and certain individuals whom I call my friends,
                    where we strengthened our bond significantly. During the course of the final grade, I changed my way of thinking and became more
                    myself, one could say I discovered better who I was.</font>
                 <dd><font color=800080>During this stage, I excelled both academically and in sports, which made me more relaxed, and I enjoyed the school experience immensely.
