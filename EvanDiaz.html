             <br><dt><font color=#0000FF>My beginning in soccer.
                <dd><font color=408080>Initially, I had no interest in soccer as such, until some friends made it more appealing to me.
                     That's how I got to know my team, "VALLE DEL SOL." At the age of 8, I joined this team where I experienced the passion
                     for soccer. We were considered the best or one of the best; we won a lot of awards and trophies, until I got injured.
                     At that moment, I went through a tough time, fell into a kind of depression, and gained weight.</font>
