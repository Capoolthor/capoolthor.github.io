                <br>In the first period, it was a great challenge at the beginning since I had no knowledge of how
                    the high school system worked, causing me to experience significant stress.
                <br>By the second period, I managed to stabilize myself better and began to understand how to handle
                    things, although I focused a lot on giving my studies 100%.
                <br>In the third period, I have been able to handle my time, topics, studies, personal relationships,
                    and soccer very well.</font>
