            <dd><font color=#FF0080> WHO I AM? ...
               <br> A profound and challenging question.
              <br>  I am a reserved individual but can easily interact with anyone if the person
                I am interacting with wants to get to know me. Upon getting to know me,
               I tend to be an interesting person who can discuss various topics and intertwine
               them with more subjects.
               <br> I enjoy experimenting with various things, such as food, experiences in the sense
                of enjoying an activity like a game or more adrenaline-fueled pursuits, among other things.
               <br> I am someone you can engage with and have a good time learning and enjoying, whether it's a
                fun moment or times when help is needed. In those moments, I can be a friend who listens to
                you in your times of need and offers perspectives on what is right or wrong, always supporting
                you in your decisions.
                <br>I am sociable but also reserved, which complicates my interpersonal relationships to some extent.
               <br> However, this also supports my ability to understand the decisions of those close to me in the context
                of sincere friendship.
                <br>I have the quality of excelling in most things, thanks to my adaptability in physical, mental, and emotional
                activities.
                <br>I love learning and discovering a wide range of things. I also enjoy cooking, drawing, photography, and more.
                I consider myself an honest and sincere person, although it is challenging for me to open up if it's not with
                the right person. I also have ambition, by which I mean I seek to improve as a person, student, and friend.
                <br>Personally, I aim to be and give my best in any situation, to discover myself as an individual, achieve goals,
                and evolve in every sense for the future. </font>
