                 <dd><font color=800080>In elementary school, I was a calm but not quiet kid. I was always surrounded
                    by a diverse group of people, and I was someone who enjoyed playing, with a natural aptitude for sports.
                    Academically, I was always a good student, without any fights or scoldings, at most just occasional reprimands
                    but they were always very rare. I didn't have to make a great effort in my studies, and the subjects came easily to me.
                    I particularly liked mathematics, especially a book I had called "Singapore," and the English book, which was very multifaceted,
                    covering reading, spelling, grammar, math, science, among others. I believe that this way I was able to learn English very effectively.</font>
                 <dd><font color=800080><br>The only conflict I ever had was with a child who bothered me without justification in 4th grade, and I went through a
                    tough time since it had never happened to me before. However, I feel that, in a way, it helped shape me as a person.
